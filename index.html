Dear Belinda，</p>
        <p>Today, as you celebrate your 23rd year, I want to pour my heart into words that may, in some small way, remind you of how deeply cherished you are.</p>
        <p>I know you've taken on the role of an elder sister to your younger siblings with so much love and responsibility. You've been a guiding light for them, making sure they feel safe and cared for.</p>
        <p>But sometimes, I can't help but think about those quiet moments when you might feel a bit lonely.         

<p>As you start this new chapter of your 23 - year - old life, may love find you in the most unexpected ways. May you be surrounded by friends who cherish you, and may you discover a love that makes you feel truly seen and cherished.</p>
        <p>Remember, I'm always here for you. Whether you want to share a funny story over a cup of coffee, or you need someone to hold your hand during tough times, I'll be right by your side.</p>
        <p>Happy birthday, Belinda! Here's to a year filled with more laughter, more love, and countless beautiful surprises.</p>
        <p>With all my affection, Howard</p>
